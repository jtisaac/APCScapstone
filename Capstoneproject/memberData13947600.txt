Recently rated events that have not yet been rerated into chronological order are indicated with a double asterisk (**). The post-event ratings from those events (and subsequent events) may change when they are rerated. (Events rated prior to 2004 are shown in the order in which they were originally rated.) Events that are submitted late or out of chronological order will appear to have been rated out of ending-date order until the next time we re-rate all recent events to place them into chronological order. We normally do rerates on Tuesdays, though they may not complete until Wednesday. Results within crosstables are NOT in tiebreak order and and players may not be listed in the same order as the prize lists from an event.
